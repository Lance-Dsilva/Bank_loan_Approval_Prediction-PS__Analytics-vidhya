<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project is made in python which uses Logistic Regression algorithm for making this ML model that predicts whether the customer will get loan based on certain information or not

Many algorithms are tested and depending upon the f1 score the best model of classification is selected and used.

### Built With

* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/m)


### Installation

This are the various libraries that need to be installed prior
```sh
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```








### Usage-

Our Loan_Approval detection project can be used to detect whether the customer would likely get loan or not.
The prediction is done based on few parameters:

1.Gender

2.Married

3.Dependents

4.Education

5.Self_Employed

6.ApplicantIncome

7.CoapplicantIncome

8.Loan_Amount_Term

9.Loan_Amount

10.Credit_History

11.Property_Area

This is useful nowadays, as there are many such cases wherein we actually can predict  based of the some parameters and by applying the algorithms
More focus of this project is for beginners who are looking forward in the field of Data science and Machine learning.
So this project is a good start for implementing different models and for visualizing data. It can also be further modified and used for industrial purpose.
